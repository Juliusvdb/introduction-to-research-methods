General Information
This study contains an analysis of the evolution of emoji usage on twitter over a decade (from 2013-2022). We applied natural language processing techniques on a large corpus of Dutch tweets to quantify and understand the evolution of emoji usage on Dutch Twitter.

Background Information
The main goal of the project is to survey the evolution of emoji usage and diversity on "Dutch-Speaking"Twitter from 2013-2022. A relevant scientific paper for the project is a paper by \cite{novak:ea:2015}, this paper provides valuable insights in the way emojis can be used to express emotions, by looking at the sentiment of the emojis. This paper can help inform us about the impact of emojis on the online conversations within the "Dutch-speaking" community.
Using a lexicon-based approach the researchers attached a sentiment-score to emojis and compare the sentiment expressed via the emojis with the sentiment expressed by the text. They applied this method to a corpus containing 1.6 million tweets in multiple languages, including Dutch.


Research Question and Hypotheses

“How has the usage of emojis increased and diversified in a Dutch Twitter corpus between 2013 and 2022 and what new categories have emerged to facilitate more inclusive and diverse digital communication within the "Dutch-Speaking"community?”

the hypothesis proposes that the usage and diversification of emojis in the "Dutch-Speaking"community has significantly increased in the period 2013-2022. With new emoji categories emerging able to facilitate more inclusive, diverse and nuanced communication through adding new activities, emotions and cultural symbols.

Method
The project analyzed emoji usage on Twitter using time as the independent variable and frequency of emoji usage as the dependent variable. A large Dutch Twitter corpus was used, with tweets obtained from a public stream based on specific keywords. A Python script was used to filter out unnecessary metadata and retweets. Regular expressions were used to organize the emojis into categories, and the method was applied to all 10 years.
