General Information
This project aims to identify common instances of language variation that can lead to misunderstandings in casual conversations. By analyzing examples of language variation that can lead to miscommunication, the project seeks to raise awareness of the importance of paying attention to such variation in communication.

Background Information
Several studies have examined the relationship between language variation and miscommunication in casual conversations. For example, Smith and Jones (2010) found that regional dialects and accents can lead to misunderstandings in communication, while Brown and Lee (2012) identified cultural differences in communication styles as a significant factor in miscommunication.

Research Question and Hypotheses
Research question: What are some common examples of language variation that can lead to misunderstandings in everyday conversations?

Hypothesis: Specific types of language variation found in everyday conversations can lead to misunderstandings between speakers.

Method
This project will involve a review of past literature on the subject of language variation and miscommunication in casual conversations. The search for relevant literature will be conducted using academic databases such as JSTOR, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The literature review will focus on identifying common instances of language variation that can lead to misunderstandings in casual conversations, as well as the impact of such misunderstandings on relationships and outcomes in various contexts, such as education, healthcare, and business. The findings of the literature review will be synthesized and used to inform the research question and hypotheses for this project.
